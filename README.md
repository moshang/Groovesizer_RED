# Groovesizer_RED
16-step sequencer and granular synth
More info: https://groovesizer.com/red/
It’s based on the original Groovesizer mk1 Arduino project. It features 16 LEDs (one per step), 5 potentiometers, and 5 buttons, MIDI input and ouput on 5-pin DINs, MIDI sync in and out, and audio out (mono) on an 1/8″ jack. There are 32 user locations for saving patterns and patches. Up to 4 patterns can be chained together to create a 4 bar pattern. Note entry can be quantized to one of 12 pre-defined scales. Patterns can be triggered and transposed via MIDI. Notes can also be entered via an attached MIDI keyboard.Features at a glance:

SYNTH
  - granular synth based on Auduino
  - synth settings saved with pattern
  - Live Play mode (via MIDI keyboard)
  - automatable grain decay 1 (sounds similar to filter cutoff)

SEQUENCER
  - note entry for individual steps or groups of up to 4 steps at once
  - rests, ties, slides and accents for each step
  - pattern length from 1 – 16 steps
  - pattern retrigger
  - tap tempo
  - 6 play modes (forward, reverse, pendulum, random interval,  drunk, random)
  - pattern transpose (semitones or octaves)
  - adjustable note duration
  - swing/shuffle
  - MIDI in/out (note, clock sync, trigger)
  - MIDI note entry
  - MIDI transpose pattern
  - send automation via MIDI cc
  - note entry quantized to 12 preset or 4 user defined scales
  - 32 save locations arranged in 8 banks of 4 patterns
  - 4 play modes per bank (loop 1, loop 2, loop 4, random)
